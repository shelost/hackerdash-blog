# Introduction

**Platformr** is a twist on the classic 2D platformer genre, where you have to create your own platforms (from a limited number, based on the level) and
try to make it to the other side.

There are **18 levels** in total — each one hand-crafted with a special set of obstacles & enemies.

Platformr is by far my favorite game that I've created personally, if only because it was the most fun to create. I got to experience level design &
unique uses of the HTML Canvas in order to make the game look & feel as immersive as possible.

This entire game was created with **~1600** lines of JavaScript code, all in a single file.
