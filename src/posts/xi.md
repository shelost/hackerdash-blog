I am writing this in September 2024, as the US-China competition is really starting to heat up into dangerous waters. The 🇺🇸 2024 US Election is coming up in a few weeks now, and Chinese President 🇨🇳 Xi Jinping is well into his unprecedented third term in office. It seems like the upcoming 4 years (2025 - 2029) are going to be the decisive period to determine who will claim global hegemony in the decades to come.

Xi is often compared to historical Chinese leaders such as 🇨🇳 Mao Zedong , 🇨🇳 Deng Xiaoping, or even ironically with the 🐲 Qianlong Emperor for his nationalistic dictatorship. While such comparisons certainly make sense in one respect or another, none of them quite had all the ingredients that describe the Xi administration.
