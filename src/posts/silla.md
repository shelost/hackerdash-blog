Everything below that? Well, the **1st, 2nd**, and **3rd** Ranks may as well as not be human.
You could only really see them in the slave-quarters of rich families.

The Harmony Council convenes to discuss the next king.


> *How about **Prince Chunchu**…?
Chunchu’s mother is a Royal, but his father is a Noble…
In that case, the child becomes a Noble as well.
A strange rule, that one… maybe not the best choice in hindsight.*


> *How about **Princess Sunhwa**…?
Did you forget? We married her off to the King of Baekje years ago!
We could invade Baekje to get her back.
I’m pretty sure they have a “no refunds” policy.*


> *That means there are only 3 Royals left….
**Seungman**, fourty-two of age… niece of the late King. Tall, fair,
**Chunmyung**, fourty-eight of age… mother of Chunchu.
**Dukman**, fourty-eight of age… daughter of the late King. Studious, wise,*

May Princess Dukman bring peace to the land…*


> *(Altogether) And so it shall be.*


Munhee’s slave-girl asks if she can attend the coronation.

You can probably watch from behind the walls, though!*

The coronation begins.

Marshal **Yushin (37)**, Munhee’s older brother, is close with Princess Dukman.
He is the leader of the **Hwarang**, an elite training unit for young Noblemen.

> *Hey, look at me… it’s all going to be alright.
No matter what happens, your loyal servant will always be by your side, until the end.
(smiles)*

The Royal Princesses approach and joke with Dukman.

> *Never thought I’d live to see the day when one of us actually became queen…
Yeah, spoiled brat, you’ll let me have a turn on the throne, right? Ha!*

The Hwarang Knights, including **🟣 Bidam (27), 🟡 Alchun (27),** and 🟢 **Pumsuk (14),** pledge allegiance to the throne.

> *We, the young Hwarang knights of Silla, pledge eternal allegiance to the Queen!*

Finally, Munhee arrives just in time backstage for the coronation.

> *(pant) (pant) the… crown….
Oh… your majesty… congratulations…*

At the end of the ceremony, everyone chants for their new queen.

> *Long live the Queen!
Long live the great Hwarang spirit!
Long live Silla!*

The young Hwarang Pumsuk (14) hands the young Gotaso (5) a flower.

> *What a cute little girl…*

Silla sends envoys to the other kingdoms to let them know of their new queen.

Bah! Good riddance.
